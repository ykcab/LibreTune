# 3D Visualization

View tables in three dimensions for better understanding.

## Opening 3D View

1. Open a 2D table
2. Click the **3D** button in the toolbar
3. The 3D view appears alongside or replaces the 2D grid

> The 3D toggle is available on every table editor — standalone tables opened
> in a tab as well as tables embedded inside dialogs (via the compact title-bar
> button).

## Navigation

### Mouse Controls
- **Left-click + Drag**: Rotate view
- **Right-click + Drag**: Pan view
- **Scroll wheel**: Zoom in/out

### Keyboard Controls
- **Arrow keys**: Rotate view
- **+/-**: Zoom in/out
- **Home**: Reset to default view

## Display Options

### Surface Style
- **Solid**: Filled surface with shading
- **Wireframe**: Grid lines only
- **Points**: Data points only

### Color Mapping
- **By Value**: Color indicates Z value
- **By Change**: Color indicates difference from baseline
- **Solid**: Single color

### Grid Overlay
Toggle grid lines on the surface to show cell boundaries.

## Live Cursor

When connected to ECU with Follow Mode enabled:
- A marker shows current operating point on the 3D surface
- Trail line shows recent history
- Current cell is highlighted

## Editing in 3D

You can edit values directly in 3D view:
1. Click on a point/cell
2. Use +/- keys to adjust
3. Changes reflect immediately

## Tips

### Finding Problems
- Look for "spikes" or "holes" in the surface
- Smooth surfaces generally indicate good calibration
- Abrupt changes may indicate errors

### Understanding Flow
- The 3D view shows how values transition
- Helps visualize the relationship between axes
- Useful for understanding table behavior
