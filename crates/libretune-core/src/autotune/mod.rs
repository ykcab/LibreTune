//! AutoTune Module
//!
//! Implements automatic VE table tuning based on real-time AFR data.
//! Features:
//! - Auto-tuning with recommendations based on AFR data
//! - Authority limits to restrict changes
//! - Data filtering (RPM ranges, coolant temp, custom expressions)
//! - Cell locking functionality
//! - Reference tables (Lambda Delay, AFR Target)
//!
//! AI Analysis submodules:
//! - Predictive cell filling for zero-hit VE table cells
//! - Anomaly detection for identifying suspect data and tune problems
//! - Tune health scoring with per-region quality assessment

/// Why `table_name` must not be fuel-tuned, or `None` if it may be.
///
/// AutoTune's correction is `value * (measured AFR / target AFR)`. That is only
/// meaningful for a table whose values are fuel quantity. Applied to an
/// ignition table it multiplies *degrees of advance*, and a lean cell — the
/// common case, the one that asks for more fuel — multiplies by more than one
/// and so **adds timing**, at exactly the high-load cells where that breaks
/// pistons.
///
/// Nothing checked this. Every table in the INI reached the table pickers, so
/// choosing the spark table and pressing Apply wrote scaled timing values
/// straight to it. Both entry points route through here, because a guard in one
/// picker leaves the other still able to do it — and the UI is not the place to
/// enforce a rule this expensive to get wrong.
///
/// Tables the INI labels [`TableRole::Ve`] are the accepted set. When an INI
/// declares none — no `[VeAnalyze]` section, so nothing is labelled — the rule
/// relaxes to "anything not known to be dangerous", so the feature still works
