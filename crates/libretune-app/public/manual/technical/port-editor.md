# Port Editor

The **Port Editor** allows you to configure ECU pin assignments and digital output mappings. This document covers the Port Editor UI, common configurations, and troubleshooting.

## Overview

The Port Editor lets you:

- **Assign Functions to Pins**: Map injector, ignition, and auxiliary outputs to ECU pins
- **Organize by Category**: Injectors, Ignition, Auxiliary Outputs, and inputs in separate groups
- **Visual Pin Diagram**: See hardware pinout organized by voltage levels and type
- **Validate Assignments**: Automatic warnings for unassigned required functions
- **Detect Conflicts**: Alerts when multiple functions are assigned to the same pin

## Opening Port Editor

The port editor is accessed through the **Setup** menu → **Programmable Ports**. 

**Note**: The exact menu path depends on your ECU's INI definition. Most ECUs place it under Setup, but some may have it under Tools or Hardware. The `std_port_edit` feature is built-in and will work if your INI file has a `subMenu = std_port_edit, "Label"` entry in the `[Menu]` section.

## User Interface

### Left Panel: Function Assignments

Shows all available functions grouped by type:

- **Injectors**: INJ1-INJ8+ (required = at least INJ1)
- **Ignition**: IGN1-IGN8+ (required = at least IGN1)
- **Auxiliary Outputs**: AUX1-AUX16 (fuel pump, fan, etc.)
- **Inputs**: TPS (throttle), MAP (boost), CLT (coolant temp), IAT (intake), O2 (oxygen), Battery voltage, VR sensors (crank/cam)

Each function shows:
- **Icon**: Color-coded dot indicating function type
- **Name**: Function label (e.g., "Injector 1")
- **Required Badge**: Red badge for functions that must be assigned
- **Dropdown**: Select which physical pin this function uses

### Right Panel: Hardware Pinout

Visual representation of available pins:

- **High-Side Outputs**: HSO1-HSO8 (12V injector drivers)
- **Low-Side Outputs**: LSO1-LSO8 (5V ignition drivers)
- **Analog Inputs**: ADC0-ADC7 (sensor inputs)
- **Digital & VR Inputs**: DIN1-DIN8, VR1±, VR2± (crank/cam sensors)
- **CAN Bus**: CANH, CANL (if supported)

Pin colors indicate:
- **Solid Border**: Already assigned to a function
- **Dashed Border**: Available for assignment
- **Color**: Matches the function type (green=injector, orange=ignition, etc.)

### Search & Warnings

**Search Filter**: Type to find functions quickly (e.g., "fuel" finds "Fuel pump")

**Warning Banner** (if present):
- Shows unassigned required functions in red
- Displays number of conflicts (if any)
- Maximum 3 warnings shown; click to expand

### Conflict Detection Rules

The pre-burn pin conflict scan follows these rules:

- **A switched-off feature does not claim its pin.** Many INI pin fields
  declare the condition under which they apply (e.g. the knock pin only
  matters when knock detection is enabled). When that condition evaluates
  false, the pin is treated as unassigned — it neither raises a conflict nor
  blocks another function from using the pin. An unparseable condition keeps
  the pin in the scan, because a missed conflict is worse than a spurious
  one.
- **"Board Default" is not a pin.** Selectors left on the board-default
  value don't participate in conflict checks.
- **Loading a tune is never blocked by pin lint.** Conflicts warn before a
  burn; they don't stop you opening someone else's tune.

## Common Configurations

### 4-Cylinder Engine (Speeduino)

```
Injectors:
  INJ1 → HSO1
  INJ2 → HSO2
  INJ3 → HSO3
  INJ4 → HSO4

Ignition:
  IGN1 → LSO1
  IGN2 → LSO2
  IGN3 → LSO3
  IGN4 → LSO4

Inputs:
  TPS → ADC0
  MAP → ADC1
  CLT → ADC2
  IAT → ADC3
  O2 → ADC4
  Battery → ADC5
  Crank → VR1+/VR1-
  Cam → VR2+/VR2- (optional)

Auxiliary:
  Fuel Pump → LSO7
  Fan → LSO8
```

### 6-Cylinder Engine (rusEFI)

Similar to 4-cylinder, but with:
- INJ1-INJ6, IGN1-IGN6 assignments
- Same input structure
- May use different pin names depending on board

### Turbocharged Engine

Same as naturally aspirated, but may include:
- **Boost Control**: AUX1 for wastegate solenoid
- **Anti-Lag**: AUX2 for fuel cut solenoid
- Same injector/ignition structure

## Best Practices

1. **Assign all required functions** before saving
   - Required functions have a red "Required" badge
   - System warns if any are unassigned

2. **Use high-side outputs for injectors**
   - HSO (12V) is designed for injector drivers
   - Provides adequate current for fuel injectors

3. **Use low-side outputs for coils**
   - LSO (5V) drives ignition coil primary circuits
   - Matches typical coil driver specifications

4. **Separate input types by ADC channel**
   - Each analog input should use a unique ADC channel
   - Shared channels cause crosstalk and interference

5. **Verify pinout with ECU schematic**
   - Different boards have different physical pin layouts
   - Always reference your ECU's documentation

6. **Test with a multimeter** (power cycle required):
   - After saving configuration, power the ECU
   - Test each output pin for correct voltage/ground
   - Verify inputs read correct sensor values

## Troubleshooting

### "Function X is already assigned" error

**Cause**: Two functions were trying to use the same pin

**Solution**: 
1. Select a different pin for one of the functions
2. Check the visual pin diagram for available pins
3. Resolve all conflicts before saving

### "Required function X is not assigned" warning

**Cause**: A function marked as "Required" was left unassigned

**Solution**:
1. Click the warning to see which functions are missing
2. Assign each required function to an available pin
3. Save will be blocked until all required functions are assigned

### Port editor doesn't open

**Cause**: 
- Menu item "Programmable Ports" is not in your INI's `[Menu]` section
- INI version doesn't include the port editor feature

**Solution**:
- Check that your INI has: `subMenu = std_port_edit, "Programmable Ports"` in the `[Menu]` section
- If not present, you may need to upgrade your ECU firmware or INI definition
- Not all ECUs support port configuration
- Check your ECU documentation for supported features

### Changes not persisting

**Cause**: Did not click **Save Configuration** button

**Solution**:
- Always click **Save Configuration** to persist changes
- Unsaved changes indicator shows "Unsaved changes" in red
- Closing without saving will discard your assignments

## Per-ECU Notes

### Speeduino

- Megasquirt-compatible pinout on most boards
- Carefully verify your specific board layout (v0.3, v0.4, v3.57, etc.)
- Most common: STM32F407 with standard pin arrangement

### rusEFI (STM32 boards)

- Pin names vary by board (Proteus F4, Frankenso, etc.)
- Always reference the specific board's pinout diagram
- Some boards have limited pin count (check your variant)

### epicEFI

- Similar to rusEFI pinout
- Verify board variant (256C, etc.)
- May support dual-bank fuel injection on some configurations
