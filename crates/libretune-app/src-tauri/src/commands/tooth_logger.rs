//! Tooth logging driven by the INI, and for as long as the user wants.
//!
//! The previous implementation invented its own protocol. For the tooth logger
//! it sent `H` and read the reply as data — but `H` is the INI's *startCommand*,
//! so the reply is empty and the log never begins. For the composite logger it
//! sent `O`, which is not a read command at all: it is the START command of a
//! different logger, `compositeLogger2`. It then decoded whatever came back
//! against a "2-byte count, then 2-byte tooth number, then time in 0.5 µs"
//! layout that appears nowhere in any INI.
//!
//! What the INI actually declares:
//!
//! ```text
//! loggerDef = tooth, "Tooth Logger", tooth
//!    startCommand    = "H"
//!    stopCommand     = "h"
//!    dataReadCommand = "T\$tsCanId\x01\xFC\x00\x01\xFC"
//!    continuousRead  = true
//!    dataReadyCondition = { toothLog1Ready == 1 }
//!    recordDef   = 0, 0, 4
//!    recordField = toothTime, "ToothTime", 0, 32, 1.0, "uS"
//! ```
//!
//! `continuousRead` is the reason TunerStudio logs for minutes and this logged
//! for half a second: 127 is the size of the ECU's buffer, not the length of a
//! log. The firmware refills it and raises `toothLog1Ready` again, so a caller
//! that reads once mistakes one bufferful for the hardware's limit.
//!
//! # This perturbs a running engine
//!
//! Tested on a Speeduino 202501 / ATmega2560: starting the tooth logger makes a
//! running engine misfire. The cost is in the firmware, not the host - `H` puts
//! it into logging mode and it then writes a record inside the trigger ISR on
//! every tooth, which delays the ignition and injection scheduling that shares
//! that path. Pacing the host reads was tried and does not help, because the
//! work happens whether anything reads or not.
//!
//! So this is a stationary diagnostic. It is genuinely useful for checking
//! trigger patterns, decoder setup and missing-tooth alignment while cranking
//! or at a steady idle, and it should not be used to chase a fault that only
//! appears under load - it will add a misfire to whatever is being hunted.
//! `start_tooth_capture` refuses above a conservative rpm for that reason.
