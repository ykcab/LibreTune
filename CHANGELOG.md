## [Unreleased]

### 2026-08-23 — Dashboard performance & readability (issue #82)

The dashboard redraw path was reworked around the three complaints in issue
#82: extreme CPU load on battery, jumping value text when digit count or sign
changes, and line graphs that look like an audio waveform at high stream
rates.

#### Added
- **Configurable gauge refresh rate** — Settings → General → Dashboard →
  "Gauge refresh rate" (10/15/20/25/30 Hz, default 30). Gauge redraw timers
  are phase-staggered (16 slots, deterministic per channel) so a dashboard
  full of gauges no longer piles all canvas work onto the same frame.
- **Transient spike highlight** — when the raw channel value deviates from
  the EMA-smoothed display value by more than 15% of the gauge range, digital
  readouts flash the value in the critical color (~400 ms) and line graphs
  draw a colored dot at the raw sample position, so short problem pulses stay
  visible despite smoothing (the issue's "peak detect" ask).
- **Right-align gauge values setting** (opt-in, default off) — digital/bar
  gauges anchor value text to a fixed right edge; dial gauges pad values to a
  fixed monospace width (`steadyValueText`), so number of characters changing
  no longer shifts glyphs.

#### Changed
- **Value smoothing is now a time-constant EMA** (`components/gauges/ema.ts`,
  τ=120 ms) instead of a per-frame lerp factor, so motion converges
  identically at any refresh rate (the old lerp converged ~6× slower at
  10 fps than at 60 fps).
- **LineGraph renders the EMA of the history buffer** rather than raw
  samples, eliminating the noisy "audio wave" look.

#### Fixed
- **`pub mod tooth_logger;` restored** in `commands/mod.rs` — the PR #247
  merge dropped the declaration, leaving `main` not compiling
  (`commands::tooth_logger::*` references in `lib.rs`).

#### Notes
- No `.dash` format changes: refresh/smoothing settings are app-global, not
  per-gauge, so TunerStudio dashboard files round-trip unchanged.

### 2026-08-21 — Fix: open-table render storm with live data (freeze on open)

Opening the fuel table with a live stream froze the window (issue #132): the
grid re-rendered at up to ~40 Hz and every one of the 256 cells re-derived
the whole-grid min/max (flattened twice per cell, since `data.min`/`max` are
never populated) plus regex color parsing per call — enough allocation and
CPU to saturate the WebView main thread. Merely opening a table also paid an
unfiltered ~100 ms string-context build server-side.

#### Fixed
- **Z min/max computed once per data change** (`tuner-ui/TableEditor.tsx`):
  new `zBounds` memo replaces the per-cell `Math.min(...zValues.flat())` /
  `Math.max(...)` scans; each cell's color is now derived once instead of
  twice (background + contrast text both called `getValueColor`).
- **Live-position identity stabilized.** The raw position memo produced a
  fresh `{row, col}` object on every realtime tick, so the history-trail
  effect re-fired per tick and queued a second render even when the cursor
  stayed in the same cell — the render amplifier behind the storm.
- **Trail state no longer churns.** The trail-append and cleanup paths return
  the previous array when nothing changed (the old code always allocated a
  new filtered array, forcing a re-render every 200 ms tick).
- **Trail fade driven by a ~5 Hz tick that only runs while trail entries
  exist**, instead of accidental re-renders.
- **Per-cell trail lookup is a Map** built once per trail change instead of
  `Array.find` per cell per render. Behavioral fix included: a re-entered
  cell (A→B→A) now fades from its *newest* visit — `find()` returned the
  oldest duplicate entry and showed a freshly re-entered cell as faded.
- **Same fixes in the dialog-embedded grid** (`tables/TableGrid.tsx`
  `getCellColor`): `zBounds` memo replaces per-cell whole-grid scans.
- **`get_table_data` builds a filtered string context.** Only the two
  axis-label display strings are evaluated, so `build_string_context_filtered`
  is used with their referenced identifiers instead of the unfiltered
  ~100 ms build (which also held the definition/tune/project locks), making
  table-open visibly snappier against a live ECU.

#### Tests
- New `TableEditor.trail.test.tsx` regression tests, verified failing against
  the pre-fix code: (1) a re-entered cell fades from its newest visit, and
  (2) same-cell realtime ticks no longer queue an extra render.

### 2026-08-21 — Alpha-N / ITB: Control Algorithm field, AutoTune auto-detect, rejection indicator

Closes the remaining gaps from #132 (the PR #162 follow-up): an ITB/Alpha-N
user could not select the fuel algorithm anywhere, AutoTune could not
auto-detect a TPS load source on Speeduino, changing the algorithm did not
re-scale the load axis, and a filter-rejected session was indistinguishable
from a broken one.

#### Added
- **Control Algorithm selector in Engine Constants.** The Speeduino `algorithm`
  constant (MAP / TPS / IMAP-EMAP) is carried by TunerStudio's built-in
  `std_injection` panel and never declared as an INI dialog field, so it was
  unreachable in LibreTune's entire UI. `EcuDefinition::std_panel_definition`
  now synthesizes it first (plus `twoStroke` / `engineType`, which the INI
  also never declares), rendered as a dropdown; MS2/MS3 (Alpha-N = 1 there
  too) gain it for free via the existing per-INI candidate skipping.
- **Changing the fuel algorithm now re-scales load axes immediately.**
  `update_constant` re-runs the expression-scale resolution when the edited
  constant feeds a scale/translate expression — directly or through an
  output-channel helper (`algorithm` → `fuelLoadRes` → the VE load-axis
  scale, detected by the new `EcuDefinition::constant_feeds_dynamic_scale`).
  When scales actually change, `tune:loaded` ("scales-resolved") refreshes
  open tables and dialogs. Previously the axis kept the old factor until the
  next full sync.
- **AutoTune auto-detects TPS load on Speeduino.** The VE load-axis channel is
  named `fuelLoad` regardless of fuel algorithm, so PR #162's channel-name
  detection could never fire. `start_autotune` (and the AutoTune view's
  auto-detect) now fall back to the `algorithm` constant: 1 = TPS/Alpha-N
  selects the throttle load source. A manual choice in the dropdown is never
  overridden (new `manualLoadSourceRef` guard on both detection effects).
- **Rejection indicator.** `AutoTuneState` counts rejected samples per filter
  reason; `get_autotune_status` exposes accepted/rejected tallies and the
  AutoTune header shows them while running (warning-styled when nothing gets
  through, hover for the full tally). A session that accepts everything no
  longer looks identical to one whose filters discard every sample.

#### Changed
- **`max_tps_rate` default 10 → 50 %/s** (core + AutoTune view). Individual
  throttle bodies snap far faster than 10 %/s, so the old default rejected
  nearly every sample on Alpha-N cars and AutoTune looked dead. Genuine accel
  transients are still caught by `exclude_accel_enrich`. Existing persisted
  settings keep their stored value.
### 2026-08-20 — Dialog fidelity pass, `.table` file IO, pin-lint gating & AutoTune sample integrity

#### Added
- **Per-table `.table` file import/export (TunerStudio-compatible)** — the
  single-table "Save Table to File" / "Load Table from File" workflow, next to
  CSV (whole-tune) IO. New core reader/writer `crates/libretune-core/src/table_file.rs`
  for the `<tableData>` XML format (verified against real TunerStudio-exported
  files), plus `export_table_to_file` / `import_table_from_file` commands
  (`commands/table_file_io.rs`) and toolbar buttons in both table editors.
  Import requires the file's dimensions to match the table's current size
  exactly — unlike TunerStudio it does not silently resample a mismatched
  grid onto the table's axes.
- **Online INI search runs automatically on signature mismatch** — the
  Signature Mismatch dialog now kicks off the online search (Speeduino /
  rusEFI / FOME sources) as soon as a mismatch is reported, keyed off the ECU
  signature so it re-runs per mismatch, and jumps straight to the online tab
  when there is no local match to show. Only the *search* is automated —
  applying an INI still requires an explicit Download click.
- **AFR Delay Test (Tools → AFR Delay Test…)** — automated exhaust
  transport-delay measurement (shipped Aug 6, hardened in this pass; see
  Fixed below). Steps fuel through `wueRates[9]`, overlays the sampled
  pulse/AFR traces, and reports the measured delay so it can be entered as
  AutoTune's `lambda_delay_ms`. Runs until stopped so a whole drive fills
  the RPM/load map.
- **INI `xAxis` layout hint respected for top-level panels** — dialog
  panels carrying the INI's xAxis layout hint now lay their field grid out
  accordingly instead of ignoring it.

#### Fixed
- **AutoTune dropped a third to a half of all samples in strict mode** — the
  delayed-sample match window was a fixed 50 ms while real hardware samples
  every 111–200 ms (single-shot reads contend with the realtime poll for the
  connection lock), so good matches were rejected. The tolerance now follows
  the stream's measured cadence (0.6× the mean sample gap, floored at the
  historical 50 ms). This was the "AutoTune runs but recommendations never
  accumulate" symptom.
- **Overrun fuel-cut and railed wideband readings polluted AutoTune** —
  samples taken during fuel cut (injectors off, wideband pinned lean) asked
  for maximum enrichment in exactly the low-load cells every lift passes
  through; readings below ~10 or above ~19.5 AFR are a sensor at a stop, not
  a mixture. Both are now excluded, with named `rejection_reason`s in the
  diagnostic log. `VEDataPoint::default()` now uses 14.7 rather than a
  physically impossible 0.0 AFR.
- **AFR delay test measured the leading edge, not the delay** — a step
  response is the cumulative distribution of transit times, so its
  half-height is the *median* transit (the transport delay); the leading
  edge is just the fastest path through the manifold and sits in the noise
  (median 268 ms scattering 8–2117 ms vs. 435 ms ± 30 ms IQR for
  half-excursion on the same 80 steps). `detect_delay` now reports the
  half-excursion crossing, keeps the old figure as `leading_edge_ms`,
  rejects unsettled traces (`ResponseNotSettled`) with a "hold longer than
  N ms" hint, samples the settle window so recovery traces are drawn, and
  guards against concurrent runs (a second start mid-step previously read
  the enriched value as its baseline and could leave the engine rich in RAM).
- **Pin lint: a switched-off feature no longer claims its pin** — the
  pre-burn conflict scan counted every pin selector in the INI, enabled or
  not, so a bone-stock Speeduino tune raised an eight-line conflict warning
  on every burn (sixteen Auxin selectors on two analog pins, knock_pin on
  ignBypassPin with detection off, …). A pin field whose INI enable
  condition evaluates false now drops out of the scan and out of the
  assignment-denial check; unparseable conditions stay in the scan (a missed
  conflict is worse than a spurious one). Also: `'Board Default'` is not a
  pin, and loading a tune is no longer blocked by pin lint. Both behaviours
  are pinned by tests.
- **Dialog fields with only an enable condition were hidden instead of
  disabled**, command-button and indicatorPanel labels showed raw
  `{expression}` text instead of the evaluated result, dynamic units showed
  the raw expression, `indicatorPanel` without an explicit `columns` count
  was dropped entirely, indicator tiles overflowed their text, and the
  two-column field grid inside `xAxis` rows collapsed into one column — all
  fixed to match TunerStudio rendering.
- **Sidebar now highlights the currently open item** in the project tree.
- **Table editor**: the Interpolate shortcut (`/`) no longer steals focus
  to the search box; Y-axis bin labels are no longer hidden on tables with
  more than 12 rows.
- **Dashboard drag-and-drop works in the Tauri webview** — Tauri's native
  drag-drop handler was swallowing the HTML5 DnD events the gauge designer
  relies on; it is now disabled for the webview.
- **HotkeyEditor infinite re-render loop** in the Settings dialog (PR #230,
  with a new regression test).
- **INI parser**: expression-valued `scale`/`translate` are now resolved
  instead of silently falling back to 1.0; the two `DEFAULT_SYMBOLS` parser
  tests are serialized (they shared a process-global symbol table and
  flaked under parallel execution).

#### Changed
- **CI modernized** — the flaky legacy pipelines were replaced with a lean
  gated flow: reusable composite actions
  (`.github/actions/setup-rust`, `setup-linux-deps`,
  `collect-tauri-artifacts`) shared across `ci.yml` / `nightly.yml` /
  `release.yml`, plus a new `.cargo/audit.toml` gating `cargo audit`.

### 2026-08-18 — Spark generator: combustion chamber & boost (psi)

#### Added
- The ignition generator now also accounts for **combustion chamber design**
  (open chamber / 2-valve quench / multi-valve swirl) via the new
  `EngineSpec::combustion_chamber`, folded into `max_spark_advance` (slower
  burn → more advance). The Generate dialog exposes it for ignition tables.
- Boost is now entered as **gauge psi** in the Generate dialog (converted to
  absolute kPa internally), matching TunerStudio's spark generator inputs.

### 2026-08-17 — Per-table generator ("Generate…" in the table editor)

#### Added
- **Generate a single table from engine specs, TunerStudio-style.** The base-map
  generators (VE / ignition / AFR) were previously reachable only through the
  one-shot base-map wizard. The table editor's right-click menu now offers a
  **"Generate <VE / Ignition / AFR Target> Table…"** action for those tables,
  which seeds the open table over its **current axes** and applies the result as
  a single undoable edit (nothing is burned to the ECU automatically).
  - New Tauri command `generate_table_values(table_name, rpm_bins, load_bins, …engine spec)`
    (`crates/libretune-app/src-tauri/src/commands/generate_table.rs`). It
    classifies the table by its INI-derived `TableRole` and falls back to the
    same name lists `apply_base_map` uses, then calls the existing
    `generate_ve_table` / `generate_ignition_table` / `generate_afr_table`
    core generators. Returns `{ table_type, z_values }`.
  - New frontend: `GenerateTableDialog` (compact engine-spec form) and a
    `classifyGeneratableTable` helper (`utils/tableGenerator.ts`) that gates the
    menu affordance. The context menu shows the action only for VE/ignition/AFR
    tables.
  - Tests: Rust unit tests for the name/role classifiers, and vitest coverage
    for `classifyGeneratableTable` / `generatableTableLabel`.
### 2026-08-17 — Table "Interpolate" NaN fix on single-row/column selections

#### Fixed
- **`Interpolate` (bilinear, the `/` key) corrupted a whole row or column with
  `NaN`** — `interpolate_cells` computed the blend ratio as
  `(y - min_y) / (max_y - min_y)`. When the selection was a single row or a
  single column that denominator is `0`, and Rust evaluates `0.0 / 0.0` to
  `NaN` (no panic), so every selected cell was silently overwritten with `NaN`.
  Because the value could then be burned to the ECU, this was a data-corruption
  bug, not just a display glitch. A degenerate axis is now pinned to ratio
  `0.0`, which reduces the bilinear blend to a clean **linear** interpolation
  along the remaining axis — matching TunerStudio's behaviour for a 1×N or N×1
  selection. Rectangular selections are unchanged (the 3×3 centre still blends
  to the corner mean).
- **Out-of-bounds selections are now a guaranteed no-op** — if any of the four
  corners falls outside the current table (e.g. a stale selection left over
  after `rebin_table` shrank the grid) the operation returns the table
  unmodified instead of reading past the edges.

#### Added
- Regression tests in `crates/libretune-core/tests/table_ops.rs`:
  `test_interpolate_cells_single_row_is_linear_not_nan`,
  `test_interpolate_cells_single_col_is_linear_not_nan`, and
  `test_interpolate_cells_out_of_bounds_selection_is_noop`; the existing 3×3
  test now also asserts the exact bilinear centre (`37.5`).

### 2026-08-17 — Issue #129: apply seven parsed-but-ignored .dash gauge properties at render time

#### Fixed
- **`face_angle` never shaped the gauge face** — roughly a third of stock
  TunerStudio gauges are authored with `FaceAngle=180/182/188` (half-sweep
  faces), but every analog gauge rendered as a full circle. New shared
  geometry helper (`painters/gaugeGeometry.ts`, `resolveGaugeArc`) resolves
  the effective needle sweep (clamped to the face extent — the needle never
  travels outside the face) and the face arc (centered on the sweep, which
  reproduces the 182/188 "sweep + margin" shapes). `analogGauge.ts` now
  draws a sector face (wedge background, arc-band bezel, text anchored
  outside the flat side) when `face_angle < 360`; full-circle faces render
  exactly as before. Also corrected the Rust default/parse-fallback for
  `FaceAngle` from 270 → 360 (stock corpus values are only 360/180/182/188;
  TunerStudio renders absent-FaceAngle gauges as full circles, and 270
  would have shrunk them into sectors).
- **`history_value` never seeded the peak marker** — TunerStudio persists
  the last peak in the file; the renderer now seeds `peakValueRef` from it
  (clamped to range) when `peak_hold` is on (`peakTracking.ts::seedPeak`).
- **`history_delay` never decayed the peak marker** — the peak only ever
  ratcheted upward for the life of the gauge. New pure state machine
  (`peakTracking.ts::nextPeakState`) ratchets upward and, once
  `history_delay` ms elapse without a new peak, lets the marker fall back to
  the present value. `history_delay <= 0` holds forever (semantics
  undocumented; matches previous behavior).
- **`default_min`/`default_max` were unreachable** — the dashboard designer's
  property editor now shows a "Reset range to default" button when the gauge
  carries authored defaults, restoring the TunerStudio-authored range.
  `.dash` Min/Max and the INI range auto-sync remain authoritative at render.

#### Docs
- `gauge_style` and `needle_smoothing` are now documented as intentional
  render-time no-ops (Rust `types.rs` + `dashTypes.ts`): `gauge_style` is
  provenance only (painter selection is `gauge_painter`; TS styles are
  free-form names with no in-file definition), and `needle_smoothing` is
  uniformly 1 across the stock corpus with undocumented semantics — applying
  it would invent behaviour (per the issue reporter's recommendation).

#### Tests
- Rust: `face_angle` parse/round-trip regression tests (PR #125 pattern)
  incl. absent → 360 and malformed → 360 fallbacks.
- Vitest: `gaugeGeometry.test.ts` (11 tests — full-circle passthrough,
  180/182 sector centering, sweep clamp, ccw mirroring, garbage face values)
  and `peakTracking.test.ts` (9 tests — seed/clamp, ratchet, hold, decay,
  hold-forever on `<= 0`, decay clock for seeded peaks).

### 2026-08-17 — Online INI discovery covers FOME

#### Added
- **FOME added as an online INI source.** The online INI repository
  (`search_online_inis` → `OnlineIniRepository`) previously fetched definitions
  only from Speeduino and rusEFI. It now also fetches FOME's TunerStudio INIs
  (`FOME-Tech/fome-fw/firmware/tunerstudio`), so signature-based discovery works
  for FOME ECUs too. The `"fome"` source string is accepted by `download_ini`.

#### Changed
- The set of upstream sources the search iterates over is now centralized in
  `IniSource::online_sources()` (previously a hard-coded array inside
  `refresh_cache`), so adding future platforms is a one-line change plus URLs.
  Added tests asserting every online source has both a GitHub API URL and a
  raw-content prefix, and is never the `Custom` (no-upstream) tag.

### 2026-08-13 — std_injection panel synthesis & offline constant reads

#### Fixed
- **`reqFuel` (and all injection constants) missing from the Engine Constants
  dialog** (Issue #152) — the Speeduino/MS2/MS3 `engine_constants` dialog nests
  a built-in TunerStudio panel via `panel = std_injection`. `std_injection` is
  not a `dialog =` defined in any INI; it renders `reqFuel`, `divider`,
  `alternate`, `injType`, `nCylinders`, `nInjectors`, `injOpen` from
  `[Constants]`. LibreTune's `buildStdPlaceholderDefinition` was pre-empting
  resolution of `std_injection` with a single placeholder `Label`, so the
  entire panel collapsed to one line of text and every constant in it
  (including `reqFuel`) was invisible. This was not a tune-import bug — the
  MSQ constants parsed and applied fine; only the UI was stubbed out.
  - Added `EcuDefinition::std_panel_definition(name)` (core), which synthesizes
    a real `DialogDefinition` from the candidate constants actually present in
    the loaded INI (missing candidates are skipped, so the same panel adapts
    across Speeduino/MS2/MS3 despite naming differences). `get_dialog_definition`
    consults it after the real-dialog lookup.
  - Extended to `std_ms3Rtc` (Speeduino RTC panel) → surfaces `rtc_trim`.
  - Frontend: removed the pre-emptive `std_injection` placeholder;
    `buildStdPlaceholderDefinition` is now the *final* fallback for genuinely
    unknown `std_*` panels (e.g. `std_ms2gentherm`).
  - Drive-by: `std_panel_definition` previously hardcoded
    `title: "Injection Setup"` for all panels; refactored to a per-panel
    `(title, candidates)` tuple so `std_ms3Rtc` is correctly titled.
  - Validated against a 687-file ECU corpus (rusEFI/epicEFI/FOME/Speeduino/
    MS2/MS3/MShift): 100% parse success; `reqFuel` present in every affected
    platform.

- **Every constant displayed `0` offline for `<pageData>`-format MSQs** —
  `get_constant_value`'s offline branch read *only* from `tune.constants`
  (named `<constant>` XML tags) and returned `0` when not found by name. But
  most MSQs (and every "Use LibreTune Settings" save) store data as raw
  `<pageData>` blobs, for which `tune.constants` is empty. The decoded data
  was sitting in the `TuneCache` the whole time, but the offline branch
  refused to fall back to it. A second instance of the same bug existed for
  bits constants (no cache fallback at all when offline).
  - Scalar path: fall through to the cache instead of returning `0.0`.
  - Bits path: added a cache fallback that extracts the packed bit field from
    the decoded page bytes.
  - This makes `get_constant_value` consistent with the canonical helper
    `read_constant_from_cache_or_tune` (CSV export / pin conflicts already did
    it correctly).

### 2026-08-01 — Table editing operations restored

#### Fixed
- **All table modifying operations failed silently-ish with "invalid args"** —
  every table op in `TableEditor2D` (`set_cells_equal`, `scale_cells`,
  `smooth_table`, `interpolate_cells`, `interpolate_linear`, `add_offset`,
  `fill_region`, `rebin_table`) passed its `invoke` arguments in snake_case
  (`table_name`, `selected_cells`, `scale_factor`, …). Tauri 2 expects
  camelCase keys and converts them to the Rust `snake_case` parameters, so it
  rejected every payload before the command body ran — e.g. *"invalid args
  `tableName` for command `scale_cells`: command scale_cells missing required
  key tableName"*. Scaling, smoothing, interpolation, fill and re-bin were all
  dead. Plain cell edits/paste/undo kept working because `update_table_data`
  was already using camelCase.
- **`>` / `<` / `+` multiplied cell values instead of nudging them** — the
  keyboard handler and toolbar buttons passed a raw multiplier (`1`, or `5`
  with Ctrl) to `handleIncrease`/`handleDecrease`, which compute
  `value * (1 ± amount)`. Pressing `>` doubled every selected cell and `+` made
  it 11×. They now step by 1% (5% with Ctrl, 10% for `+`).
- **Scale (`*` / toolbar) was a guaranteed no-op** — both entry points called
  `handleScale(1.0)`. They now open a dialog prompting for the multiplier;
  only the right-click menu previously supplied a real factor.
- **Right-click context menu targeted the wrong cell** — `TableGrid` never
  emitted the `data-x`/`data-y` attributes that `TableEditor2D`'s
  `onContextMenu` handler read, so Lock/Unlock and the menu header always
  resolved to cell `(0, 0)`. The handler also required the event target to
  *be* the `.table-cell` element, but right-clicking the number hits the inner
  value span, so the menu often didn't open at all. The cells now carry their
  coordinates, the handler walks up with `closest()`, and a right-click
  outside the current selection moves the selection to the clicked cell (the
  menu's other actions all operate on the selection).

#### Added
- Regression tests asserting the `invoke` argument keys for each table
  operation, so camelCase/snake_case drift can't silently break editing again.

### 2026-07-31 — Dashboard validation loop + Settings save performance/reliability

Fixes a runaway backend loop that starved the UI, plus several Settings-save
correctness and performance issues that surfaced once the loop was resolved.

#### Fixed
- **Infinite `validate_dashboard` loop** — `useGaugeRangeSync`'s INI/definition
  change effect listed `dashFile` and `syncGaugeRanges` (both derived from
  `dashFile`) as deps alongside `syncToken`. Syncing creates a new `dashFile`
  object → recreates `syncGaugeRanges` → retriggers the effect (syncToken stays
  > 0 after a `definition:loaded`/`ini:changed` event) → re-sync → infinite loop.
  The runaway `validate_dashboard` calls saturated the Tauri IPC, so Settings
  Apply's `await invoke('update_setting')` calls never resolved, leaving
  Apply/OK permanently disabled. Fix: the INI-change effect now depends on
  `syncToken` ONLY, reading the latest sync fn/flags/dashFile from a ref.
- **"Some settings failed to save" error** — the backend `update_setting` match
  was missing arms for `auto_commit_on_save`, `commit_message_format`,
  `fome_fast_comms_enabled`, `auto_record_enabled`, `key_on_threshold_rpm`, and
  `key_off_timeout_sec`; each hit the `_ => Err("Unknown setting")` catch-all.
  Added all six arms (and extracted the match into a shared `apply_setting`
  helper used by both the single and batch commands, so this can't regress).
- **AI assistant reported "not configured"** — `ai_provider` was saving empty.
  Leftover from the earlier `Settings::default()` corruption bug, the stored
  `""` made the Provider dropdown render blank (no matching option), so the user
  never selected one. `configured` requires a non-empty provider + model, so it
  falsely reported unconfigured. Frontend now coerces empty `ai_provider` to
  `'openai'` on load; `agent_status` treats empty provider as `'openai'`
  defensively.

#### Changed
- **Batched Settings save (performance)** — the Settings dialog previously made
  ~30 sequential `update_setting` calls on Apply/OK, each doing a full disk
  read + write cycle (~60 file operations, several seconds on Windows). Added a
  new `update_settings` (plural) command that loads settings once, applies all
  key/value pairs to one in-memory struct, and saves once — reducing I/O to a
  single read + write. `saveSettings` now sends all settings in one batched
  invoke. Save is now near-instant.

### 2026-07-31 — Menu i18n fix, menu-bar grouping, settings search

Closes [#72 ([BUG] Languages)](https://github.com/RallyPat/LibreTune/issues/72)
and adds related menu/toolbar UX improvements.

#### Fixed
- **Partial menu/toolbar translation (Issue #72)** — switching language only
  translated the menu *titles* and the Help submenu items; File/Edit/View/Tools
  *items* and all toolbar tooltips stayed English. Root cause: `buildMenuItems.ts`
  and `buildToolbarItems.tsx` hardcoded English label/tooltip strings instead of
  routing them through the already-wired `t()` function, masking the fact that
  every key already existed in all locale files. Fix routes all items through
  `t()` and bakes the `&` access-key mnemonic and `\tCtrl+X` shortcut into each
  locale value (required by `MenuBar.tsx`, which parses them from the label).
  - `buildToolbarItems.tsx` now accepts a `t: TFunction` (previously took none).
  - App.tsx gains `useTranslation('common')` for toolbar tooltips; a new
    `toolbar` section was added to all three locale `common.json` files.
  - `setupTests.ts` now initializes i18n (`import './i18n'`) so `t()` resolves
    real strings under test (previously returned raw key paths, masked by the
    old hardcoded English).
  - Hungarian `help.title` mnemonic fixed (`&Segítség`) for consistency.
  - New regression tests in `i18n/__tests__/i18n.test.ts`: locale key-parity
    across `en`/`pt-BR`/`hu-HU`, per-locale menu/toolbar resolution, and
    mnemonic/shortcut survival across locales.

#### Added
- **Menu-bar grouping with dividers** — the top menu bar is now organized into
  three zones separated by vertical rules: `File Edit View Tools │ <ECU/INI
  menus> │ Help`. The app-action menus (translated, stable positions) are
  grouped left, the ECU tuning menus (INI-native, intentionally untranslated) sit
  in the middle, and Help stays rightmost per convention. `Tools` moved left to
  join the app menus (it was previously buried after the ECU menus). Dividers are
  omitted entirely when there are no ECU menus (no dangling rule). Implementation:
  `MenuBar.tsx` top-level render loop now branches on `item.separator`, and
  ArrowRight/Left keyboard navigation computes next/prev over a focusable-filtered
  list so focus hops over dividers without landing on them.
- **"Show ECU menus in menu bar" setting** — a new Appearance → Layout toggle
  (default ON) hides the INI tuning menus from the top bar for a leaner layout.
  The menus remain reachable in the (permanent, collapsible) sidebar. New backend
  setting field `show_ecu_menus_in_menubar` with `update_setting` arm; live
  re-render + persistence across restarts.
- **Settings search bar** — the Settings dialog now has a search box in its title
  bar that filters settings **across all tabs** as you type (mirrors the sidebar
  search UX). Matching `<h3>`-anchored sections surface in a flat view (tab bar
  hides while searching); a "No settings found" message appears on no match.
  Implementation uses a DOM-based scan (matches each section's full `textContent`,
  so every label/option/note is searchable with no curated index). Panels
  all-render only during an active search to preserve existing test stability.

#### Fixed (session follow-ups)
- **Sidebar hidden by default / zeroed-out settings** — the `Settings` struct
  derived `Default`, which sets every `bool` to `false` and every `String` to
  `""`, *ignoring* the `#[serde(default = "default_true")]` attributes (those
  only apply during deserialization). When `load_settings()` had no/invalid
  file it fell back to `Settings::default()`, so every `default_true` field
  (sidebar visibility, auto-sync gauge ranges, heatmap schemes, auto-reconnect,
  FOME fast comms, alert rules, etc.) silently became false/blank and got
  persisted to disk. Replaced with an explicit `default_settings()` that uses
  the same default fns as the serde attributes, and repaired existing corrupt
  settings files on load.
- **Settings Apply/OK buttons stuck disabled** — `saveSettings()` set
  `saveStatus = 'saving'` (disabling both buttons) but the final status
  transition was only reached on the happy path; any unexpected throw left the
  dialog stuck at `'saving'` so the user had to close it via the window's X.
  Wrapped the save body in `try/catch/finally` so `saveStatus` is guaranteed
  to resolve to `'saved'`/`'error'`. Restores Windows convention: Apply saves
  and keeps the dialog open (buttons re-enable); OK saves and closes.

### 2026-07-31 — Chat history, stop button, UI state persistence

Enhancements to the AI assistant and overall workspace UX.

#### Added
- **Chat history** — assistant conversations now persist **per project** as
  JSON files under `projectCfg/ai_chats/`. The panel header gains a **chat
  switcher** (list button) and a **New chat** button (plus icon). The most
  recent chat auto-opens on launch. Chats auto-save on every message.
- **Stop button** — while the assistant is thinking, the Send button becomes
  a red Stop button that cancels the in-flight request. Backend: the turn is
  spawned as a tokio task whose `JoinHandle` is stored in `AppState.agent_task`;
  the new `agent_stop` command aborts it (mirrors the realtime-stream pattern).
  Cancellation surfaces as `_(stopped)_` in the transcript, not an error.
- **UI state persistence** — on launch the app restores sidebar visibility,
  sidebar folder expansion, AI panel visibility, and the selected dashboard.
  New settings fields (`sidebar_visible`, `agent_panel_visible`,
  `selected_dashboard`, `open_tabs`, `sidebar_expanded_ids`) with `update_setting`
  arms. Persistence is gated on a restore flag so the initial default values
  don't overwrite saved ones before the async restore completes.

#### Fixed
- **Assistant transcript reset to blank** — a stale-closure bug in
  `ChatPanel.send()` caused the transcript to reset after the first reply.
  The function now snapshots the transcript at the start of the turn and
  builds the updated transcript from that snapshot.
- **Assistant showed "disabled" while status loaded** — the panel flashed the
  "disabled" message before the status poll completed. Now shows "Loading…"
  until the status is fetched, and a specific message when enabled-but-
  unconfigured (missing risk ack or model).

### 2026-07-31 — AI Assistant (bring-your-own-LLM) + UX fixes

Adds a bring-your-own-LLM assistant that acts as a co-pilot for tuning and ECU
configuration. The model only ever *proposes* changes; every proposal is
validated against the INI, clamped to authority limits, and staged in a review
queue for explicit user approval. Nothing burns to the ECU automatically.

#### Added — AI Assistant
- **Core library** (`crates/libretune-core/src/`):
  - `agent/` module: `orchestrator` (multi-turn read→respond loop via a
    `ReadToolExecutor` trait), `tools` (tool catalogue), `context`,
    `summarize` (coverage + AFR error + anomalies aggregation), `safety`
    (authority clamping), `tiers` (constant safety tiering:
    Safe / Caution / Dangerous).
  - `llm/` module: `Provider` trait + native OpenAI / Anthropic / Google
    implementations over the existing `reqwest` client (no vendor SDK crates).
  - `TableRole` enum + `EcuDefinition::infer_table_roles()` — machine-readable
    table roles (Ve / Ignition / AfrTarget / WarmupEnrichment / Other) derived
    from the INI's `[VeAnalyze]` / `[WueAnalyze]` config, so the assistant knows
    what a table *does* without guessing from its name.
  - Extended `ActionPlayer::validate_action_set` beyond existence checks: now
    validates `Constant.min/max` bounds, `DataType` raw storage range, table
    cell-index bounds (`x_size`/`y_size`), and bits-type enum values.
- **Tauri app** (`crates/libretune-app/src-tauri/src/`):
  - `commands/agent.rs`: `agent_status`, `agent_send_message` (multi-turn loop
    with a `LiveReadExecutor` that reads tables/constants against live state),
    `agent_apply_proposals` (re-validates; stages, never burns).
  - AI settings wired through the 3-layer settings pattern (all keys present in
    `update_setting` — avoids the latent `auto_commit_on_save` bug): provider,
    base URL, API key, model, capability tier; enablement gated on a risk
    acknowledgement that resets on provider/key change.
- **Frontend** (`crates/libretune-app/src/components/`):
  - `AgentSidePanel` — docked, non-modal, resizable right-hand panel (header
    with pop-out + collapse buttons, collapsible review queue). Pop-out to its
    own window via the existing `WebviewWindow` hash-routing system (`agent`
    type in `PopOutWindow.tsx`; `agent:dock` event to restore).
  - `ChatPanel` + `ProposalQueue` — conversational transcript + per-item review
    surface with safety-tier badges and clamp notices.
  - `common/RiskAcknowledgement` — reusable risk-ack primitive (lifted from the
    firmware-update pattern).
  - Tools → AI Assistant menu entry (a toggle reflecting panel visibility).

#### Changed
- **Settings dialog Apply/OK buttons** — split the old single "Apply"
  (which saved *and* closed) into Windows-convention **Apply** (save, stay
  open, show per-setting status) and **OK** (save and close). Each setting now
  saves independently so one failure no longer silently aborts the rest — this
  was the root cause of AI provider info not persisting.
- **Default dashboard** is now **Telemetry Live** (was Basic), with Basic as
  the fallback if Telemetry Live is absent.

#### Docs
- New feature guide `docs/src/features/ai-assistant.md` (usage, providers,
  safety model, troubleshooting, privacy).
- New technical reference `docs/src/technical/ai-assistant.md` (module layout,
  agent-loop diagram, Provider/ReadToolExecutor traits, tool catalogue).
- Added AI Assistant section to the settings guide.
- Added AI Assistant entries to the technical README and SUMMARY.md.
- Added two AI FAQ entries ("Can it tune my car for me?", "Do I need
  OpenAI?").
- Synced all of the above to the in-app manual (`public/manual/` + `toc.json`).
- Added section 12 to `AGENTS.md` documenting the feature for future agents.

#### Verification
- `cargo test -p libretune-core`: all tests pass (lib + integration).
- `cargo clippy -p libretune-core --lib`: clean.
- `npm run typecheck`: clean.

### 2026-07-29 — Fix VE table scrollbar-twitch oscillation

The VE table (the only table rendered in "fit viewport" mode, where cell
sizes are computed to fill the available panel space) visibly jittered a few
times per second, with scrollbars flashing on and off around it. This was a
measure → overflow → scrollbar → re-measure feedback loop: the fit math
targeted `clientWidth`/`clientHeight` (which exclude the scrollbar) but
ignored the grid container's 2px border, so the fitted grid overshot the host
by ~2px, toggling the scrollbars every animation frame.

#### Fixed
- **`TableGrid.tsx`** — the `fitViewport` `measure()` now subtracts the grid
  container's 2px border from the available width/height before computing
  column/row sizes, so the fit no longer produces an overflowing grid.
- **`TableEditor2D.css`** — added `scrollbar-gutter: stable both-edges` to
  `.table-grid-fit-host` so `clientWidth`/`clientHeight` stay constant when
  scrollbars appear/disappear. This breaks the feedback loop as a defence in
  depth, even if a tiny overshoot is ever reintroduced.

#### Docs
- Added a "VE Table Flickers / Twitches" entry to the Troubleshooting
  reference (`docs/src/reference/troubleshooting.md`) describing the symptom,
  cause, and fix.

### 2026-07-29 — Comment overhaul (Rust tests + frontend logic)

Overhaul of code comments across the test suite and frontend logic. **No
behavioural changes** — every edit is a comment or doc-block except the two
test removals noted under *Removed*. Verified by `cargo test`
(libretune-core) and `npm run typecheck` / `npm run build` (frontend).

#### Changed
- **Rust integration tests** (`crates/libretune-core/tests/`) — replaced
  name-restating comments with assertion rationale and documented the
  non-obvious fixtures. For example, `tests/plugin_api.rs` now spells out the
  `create_test_context()` invariant (a `PluginManager` with zero plugins, so
  every permission check returns `false` — *why* every permission test expects
  denial) and labels each denial with the specific permission that would be
  required to succeed. Similar treatment for `tune.rs` (was 15 tests with zero
  comments), `plugin_system.rs`, `megatune_parsing.rs`, `action_validation.rs`,
  and `port_editor.rs`.
- **Missing module `//!` headers** added to nine test files
  (`action_validation`, `autotune_heatmap`, `evaluator`, `lua_scripting`,
  `megatune_parsing`, `protocol`, `table_ops_extended`, `tune`,
  `unit_conversion`); `lua_scripting.rs`'s `//` block was converted to `//!`.
- **Frontend HIGH-severity logic** — documented the previously-undocumented
  security-sensitive and algorithm-heavy paths:
  - `utils/evaluateIndicatorExpression.ts`: the `new Function()` security
    stance (the tokenizer restricts input to identifiers/numbers/operators,
    and every identifier is pre-substituted with a numeric literal before
    compilation, so no attacker-controlled identifier can become code), the
    single-identifier fast path, and the fail-safe fallback.
  - `components/tables/3d/SceneComponents.tsx`: the Three.js triangle winding
    order (CCW-from-above for front-face culling) and the click-handler
    face→cell reverse map (`faceIndex/2 → quad → (xi, yi)`), plus the
    `vertices.push(x, z, y)` Y-up swap.
  - `components/tables/TableEditor2D.tsx`: the `[x,y]` vs `[row,col]`
    coordinate convention, the undo/redo history-stack semantics (redo
    truncation, 50-step cap, stale-closure note), paste delimiter
    auto-detection, and the dual-threshold large-change warning with its
    divide-by-zero guard.
  - `App.tsx`: a file header describing the connection state machine phases
    and effect-ordering rationale.
- **Frontend MEDIUM-severity logic** — `TableGrid.tsx` (fractional-cell live
  cursor interpolation + the header-select heuristic),
  `DataLogView.tsx` (the quoted-CSV state machine and the TunerStudio/LibreTune
  timestamp-format detection), `useDesignerDragResize.ts` (the 8-handle resize
  math), `useDesignerHistory.ts` (redo truncation + deep-clone rationale),
  `useReconnectHandler.ts` / `useAutoConnect.ts` (the firmware-vs-command
  retry magic numbers), and `DialogRenderer.tsx` (search-highlight timeouts).

#### Removed
- **`test_crc16_calculation_deterministic`** (`tests/protocol.rs`) — a
  misleading test: despite its name it did not exercise any CRC (no CRC
  implementation exists in the codebase); it was a verbatim duplicate of
  `test_protocol_error_display`. Left an explanatory NOTE in its place.
- **`test_repository_extraction_with_comments`** (`tests/ini_parsing.rs`) — an
  empty placeholder with no assertions; its own body explained it could not
  reach the private target method from this public-API test file.

### 2026-07-29 — Add `RUST_LOG`-controlled backend logging

#### Added
- **`tracing` subscriber initialization** in the Tauri backend
  (`libretune-app/src-tauri/src/lib.rs`). Reads the `RUST_LOG` environment
  variable and defaults to `info`, so normal dev runs are no longer flooded with
  ECU protocol debug output.

#### Changed
- **ECU protocol logs now use `tracing`** — all `eprintln!` calls in
  `libretune-core/src/protocol/connection.rs` were converted to
  `tracing::debug!`, `tracing::info!`, or `tracing::warn!` based on their
  existing severity labels. Set `RUST_LOG=libretune_core::protocol=debug` to see
  the previous byte-level traffic output, or `RUST_LOG=error` to silence it.

#### Documentation
- Updated plugin-system docs (`docs/src/technical/plugin-system.md` and the
  bundled manual copy) to describe the new `RUST_LOG` filtering behavior and
  show ECU protocol examples.
- Added a "Debug Logging" section to the troubleshooting guide.
- Added a "Verbose ECU communication logs" note to the connection guide.
- Added a "Logging during development" section to `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

### 2026-07-27 — Fix ECU communication stalls (Issue #71)

#### Fixed
- **Realtime data stalls in Auto mode** — `choose_runtime_command`
  (`libretune-core/src/protocol/connection.rs`) no longer silently switches
  Speeduino / MegaSquirt (MS2/MS3) from Burst (`A`, ~1 KB/s) to OCH based on
  loose heuristics (`maxUnusedRuntimeRange`, slow-link baud/port, adaptive-timing
  averages). On real Speeduino 202501 hardware this collapsed throughput to
  ~13 B/s and froze the gauges. Auto mode now locks these ECUs to Burst; rusEFI /
  FOME / epicEFI retain the original OCH heuristics. Unknown ECU types also
  default to Burst for safety.
- **Frontend Auto mode still forced OCH** — `App.tsx` preemptively converted
  "Auto" to "ForceOCH" whenever the INI declared `ochBlockSize > 0`, bypassing
  the backend's ECU-aware selection and re-creating the stall on Speeduino. Auto
  is now passed through untouched so the backend can lock Speeduino/MS2/MS3 to
  Burst.
- **OCH fallback when `ochBlockSize` is unset** — `get_realtime_data` now falls
  back to Burst instead of guessing a 256-byte block when the INI declares no
  `ochBlockSize`, avoiding a mis-sized response that stalled the stream.
- **Disconnect did nothing while streaming** — the realtime stream task holds the
  connection mutex during blocking serial I/O, so `disconnect_ecu`'s
  `lock().await` could hang. Disconnect now polls the lock with a deadline, and
  `Connection::disconnect()` sets a cancellation flag checked by the blocking
  read loops (`send_raw_command`, `send_packet`) so an in-flight read aborts
  promptly. Added `ProtocolError::ConnectionClosed`.
- **Line graph stopped scrolling on flat values** — `realtimeStore`'s history
  buffer skipped writing duplicate values, so a constant channel froze the trace.
  It now appends every sample. Additionally, `useGaugeRenderer` kept the rAF
  loop idle once the animated value converged; LineGraph/Histogram/MultiChannelTrend
  gauges now keep rendering at a throttled rate so the time-series trace keeps
  scrolling on steady sources.
- **Realtime stream not restarted after clear** — `useRealtimeStream`'s heartbeat
  only restarted the backend stream when `lastUpdateTime > 0`; it now also
  restarts when no update has been seen shortly after connect/clear.

#### Added
- `Connection::ecu_type()` / `set_ecu_type()` / `cancel_handle()` /
  `request_cancel()` for ECU-aware runtime selection and interruptible I/O.
- Tests: `test_speeduino_auto_stays_on_burst`,
  `test_speeduino_force_och_override` (existing OCH-heuristic tests updated to
  pin `EcuType::RusEFI`).

### 2026-07-27 — CI: drop deprecated Node.js 20 actions

#### Fixed
- **CI failing on the Node.js 20 deprecation** — GitHub Actions deprecated the
  Node.js 20 runtime (the runner now force-migrates Node-20 actions to Node 24
  and emits a warning that fails the check job). Bumped the affected first-party
  actions from `@v4` (Node 20) to `@v5` (Node 24) across `ci.yml`, `nightly.yml`,
  and `release.yml`: `actions/checkout`, `actions/cache`, `actions/setup-node`.
  See
  https://github.blog/changelog/2025-09-19-deprecation-of-node-20-on-github-actions-runners/

#### Changed
- **Frontend build Node version aligned to 24** — the `setup-node` `node-version`
  in all workflows is now `'24'` (current LTS), replacing `'22'`, so the runner
  Node and the action runtime match.

### 2026-07-23 — Safe project→ECU tune apply (no reconnect brick)

#### Fixed
- **Use LibreTune Settings could corrupt/brick the ECU** — project pages are now
  materialized as ECU base + MSQ overlays (never zero-padded Load Tune pages),
  written with chunked page writes + a single burn, and complete MSQ `<pageData>`
  is treated as authoritative so stale named constants are not re-applied on the
  next connect (which previously caused a fake mismatch and a destructive rewrite).

### 2026-07-21 — Bits range parse fix (Trigger visibility)

#### Fixed
- **INI bits `[start:end]` mis-parsed as `[position:size]`** — e.g. `consumeObdSensors`
  `[6:6]` was treated as 6 bits instead of 1. Dialog conditions like
  `{ consumeObdSensors == 0 }` failed, so Trigger (and other gated menus) looked
  empty while TunerStudio showed the real settings. Size is now `end - start + 1`.

### 2026-07-20 — DFU firmware update fix + simpler dialog

#### Fixed
- **Tune mismatch wrote garbage to ECU** — Load Tune only overlays named MSQ
  constants; choosing LibreTune Settings was bulk-writing the rest as zeros.
  Sync/compare and apply now merge **ECU page base + MSQ constants** (and full
  `<pageData>` when present). Load Tune always resets the cache first.
- **DFU `.bin` flash address** — use `0x08000000` (same as epicEFI Firmware Flasher /
  rusEFI Console). The previous `0x08008000` preset could brick OpenBLT boards.
- **Signature mismatch re-prompt** — after updating the project INI for a new firmware,
  reconnect no longer re-opens the dialog for partial matches; `CurrentTune.msq`
  signature is stamped to the new INI.
- **Tune mismatch resolve** — Use LibreTune Settings saves to `CurrentTune.msq` then
  writes/burns the ECU; Use ECU Settings overwrites the on-disk MSQ from the ECU.
- **Use LibreTune Settings write timeout** — ECU page writes are chunked (blocking
  factor) with retries; full-page USB writes were hitting Windows error 121.
- **Use LibreTune Settings froze ECU link** — pause realtime streaming and disable
  per-page auto-burn during bulk write; burn once, clear RX, restart stream.
- **False “INI partially matches” toast** — ECU build-hash suffixes (rusEFI/epicEFI
  companion INIs) are treated as an exact match, not partial.

#### Changed
- **Firmware Update dialog** — addresses baked into the backend; removed editable
  address field and most guidance/tool clutter (mode + file + status/log).
- Flashing helper processes on Windows no longer pop console windows.
- Tune mismatch dialog labels: “Use LibreTune Settings” / “Use ECU Settings”.

### 2026-07-18 — Upstream PRs #60–#63 on `dev`

Cherry-picked from `main` onto `dev` with no conflicts.

#### Added
- **Live WBO status panel** beside the wideband tools dialog (#61).
- **Grouped graph-log channel picker** for clearer channel selection (#63).

#### Changed
- **Table live cursor** — follow enabled by default, more accurate marker, fading trail (#62).

#### Fixed
- **Controller command variable substitution** for wideband / hardware tools (#60).

### 2026-07-14 — Startup live telemetry monitor

#### Fixed
- **Windows installer/app icons** — cam-lobe brand mark regenerates the full
  `src-tauri/icons/` set; NSIS `installerIcon` points at `icons/icon.ico` so the
  setup `.exe` uses the same branding.

#### Added
- **Startup fixed telemetry monitor** — status strip, three colon-style columns
  (Engine · Fuel · Critical — appendable lists, no gauge tiles), live strip chart with
  pause/zoom/series toggles, status LEDs, warnings only when unhealthy. Default when
  opening the dash tab.

#### Removed
- **Telemetry Compact**, **Basic**, **Racing**, and **Command Center** built-in dashboards —
  leftover files are deleted from the dashboards folder on list/upgrade.

### 2026-07-12 — AutoTune reliability, Virtual Dyno, branding, Hardware Test layout

#### Fixed
- **Hardware Test dialog alignment** — Spark/Injector/Lua/Misc command buttons no longer
  ellipsize to `S…` / `Abor…`; Count/On/Off fields no longer crush value+units together.
  Compact test panels and auxiliary (solenoid + gauges) rows are laid out separately.
- **AutoTune target AFR was ignored** — corrections always aimed at stoich 14.7;
  the UI Target AFR setting is now used (`required_ve = current × actual/target`).
- **Recommendation `target_afr` field** stored measured AFR instead of the real target.
- **Lambda-only ECUs (e.g. rusEFI)** — AutoTune now resolves `lambda` / `lambdaValue`
  (and VeAnalyze channel hints); realtime aliases also derive `afr` from lambda.
- **Missing AFR no longer fakes 14.7** — invalid/missing wideband samples are skipped;
  UI warns when no AFR/lambda is seen while running.
- **Beginning VE from live channel** — when the VE output channel is absent/zero,
  AutoTune snapshots the VE table cells at session start and uses those values.
- **CLT filter default** aligned to °C (`60`) to match the UI (was °F-ish `160`).

#### Added
- **Virtual Dyno** — Tools → Virtual Dyno; physics pull → HP/torque curve; gated when
  VSS is not configured / faulted / missing speed channel.
- **Official app icon** — cam-lobe cyan/amber mark; full Tauri icon set generated under
  `src-tauri/icons/` (source in `branding/libretune-logo.png`).
- AutoTune start returns warnings (`AutoTuneStartResult`); `get_autotune_status` for
  AFR health; optional AFR/lambda **target table** from `[VeAnalyze]` for per-cell targets.
- Running-average of cell recommendations (was last-sample overwrite).

#### Changed
- AutoTune UI surfaces session warnings and AFR-health banners.
- **AutoTune algorithms are real** — Simple / Weighted Average / PID now change
  correction behavior (weighted favors bin-center + stable TPS; PID uses P+I on AFR error).
  Algorithm selector locks while a session is running.


### Jul 8, 2026 — Table 3D toggle & curve drag editing

#### Added
- **3D view toggle on all table editors** — `TableEditor2D` (standalone header
  + compact embedded title bar) and `tables/TableToolbar` (view controls) now
  expose a 3D toggle (Box icon) that swaps the grid for the existing
  react-three-fiber `TableEditor3D` (heatmap scheme, cell-selection sync,
  back-to-2D button). Brings the standalone and dialog-embedded editors to
  parity with the tab-based `tuner-ui/TableEditor`.
- **Click-drag curve editing** — the curve editor now lets you click anywhere
  in the plot area to grab the nearest point and drag it (direct point-grab
  still works). Drag is tracked at the window level so it continues outside
  the SVG bounds and always commits on release; crosshair/ns-resize cursor
  feedback and undo/redo history are preserved.

#### Fixed
- **Curve editor crash** — guarded remaining `undefined` bin accesses in the
  curve data points and table cells, eliminating the
  "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toFixed')" render error when
  x/y bin arrays momentarily mismatch in length.

### Sprint 3 — Spec wrap-up (S-5..S-7)

#### Added
- **Phase 3.1 / S-5 — `.tuneView` round-trip** — new
  `crates/libretune-core/src/tune_view/` module
  (`mod.rs` / `types.rs` / `parser.rs` / `writer.rs`). Generic property-bag
  data model (`TuneView` → `TuneComp` → `TuneProp` with `BTreeMap` attrs
  + free-form text) preserves any field across parse → write → re-parse,
  including unknown `tuneComp` types and color-style multi-attr properties.
  Lossless against the entire `reference/TunerStudioMS/TuneView/` corpus
  (37 stock files round-trip via new `tests/stock_ts_tune_view_corpus.rs`
  integration test). 4 inline parser tests cover the minimal element set
  and namespace-prefix handling.
- **Phase 4.1 / S-6 — `discover_ecu` probe matrix** — new
  `crates/libretune-core/src/protocol/discovery.rs` implementing spec §15.4.
  Sweeps `deviceSearchBaudRates × deviceSearchQueryCommands` per port with
  the canonical 1500 ms post-open settle / 40 ms pre-write / 600 ms read
  window. Classifies each response as `Signature` (MS-family ASCII reply),
  `Bootloader` (`b0&0xE0==0xE0 && b1&0xF0==0 && b2==b'>'`), `BigStuff3`
  (`b0==0x01`), `Echo`, `GpsReceiver` (`$GP…` reject), `Unknown`, `Silent`,
  or `OpenFailed`. Probe takes a channel-opener closure (`OpenPort`) so it
  is testable without serial hardware; 7 inline tests use a scripted
  `MockChannel` to exercise every classification path. Re-exported from
  `protocol::` as `discover_ecu`, `DiscoveryConfig`, `DiscoveryResult`,
  `DiscoveredEcu`.
- **Phase 4.2 / S-7 — Math parser audit** — added the few remaining TS
  expression functions found in stock INI corpus to
  `ini::expression::evaluate_function`: `int` / `trunc` (truncate towards
  zero), `not` (logical negation, TS spelling), `boolean` / `bool`
  (cast to bool), `pastValue(channel, n)` (degrades to current value
  pending history-buffer plumbing), and `getAuxDigital(n)` (returns 0
  pending aux-digital pin map). New regression test
  `test_ts_function_coverage` exercises 19 representative expressions plus
  the canonical `time - pastValue(time, 1)` calcField pattern from real
  ECU INIs.

#### Verification
- `cargo test -p libretune-core`: **484 tests pass** across 24 binaries
  (was 246 at start of Sprint 1).
- `cargo clippy -p libretune-core --lib --tests -- -D warnings`: clean.
- All 37 stock `.tuneView` files round-trip losslessly.

## [Unreleased — earlier sprints]

### Spec compliance — TunerStudioMS alignment (Apr 29, 2026)

LibreTune now closes the highest-priority gaps against the reverse-engineered
TunerStudioMS specification (`SPECIFICATION.md`). Work is grouped by phase;
deliberately out-of-scope items are documented in
[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

#### Added
- **Phase 1.1** — `protocol::response_code::ResponseCode` enum covering all
  spec §15.2 codes (`OK_BURN`, `BUSY`, `FLASH_LOCKED`, `CRC_MISMATCH`,
  `CAN_TIMEOUT`, etc.); `ProtocolError::EcuStatusError` carries the user-facing
  message verbatim.
- **Phase 1.3** — auto-burn safety policy. `ConnectionConfig` gains
  `auto_burn_on_page_change` and `auto_burn_on_close_dialog` (both default
  `true`); `Connection::flush_pending_burn()` exposes explicit flush for
  dialog-close events. Page transitions are tracked via `last_written_page`.
- **Phase 2.1** — INI `signaturePrefix` parsed under `[MegaTune]` and
  `[TunerStudio]`; `EcuDefinition.signature_prefix` honored by every
  signature-compare path (`connect_to_ecu`, `load_tune`,
  `signature_helpers`).
- **Phase 2.3** — 19 missing `[Constants]` keys parsed into
  `ProtocolSettings` (`tableWriteCommand`, `tableCrcCommand`,
  `tableBlockingFactor`, `replayConfigTable`, `replayReadCommand`,
  `replayRecordCountParam`, `noCommReadDelay`,
  `refreshLocalStoreOnActivity`, `defaultRuntimeRecordPerSec`,
  `restrictSquirtRelationship`, `forceBigEndianProtocol`,
  `useLegacyFTempUnits`, `surpressConfigErrorVerbiage`,
  `validateArrayBounds`, `ignoreMissingBitOptions`, `filterEchoBytes`,
  `envelopedScanCommands`, `pageActivate`, `defaultIpAddress`/`Port`).
  New `parse_ini_bool` helper.
- **Phase 2.4** — conditional section headers (`[Section &cond1 &!cond2]`)
  evaluated against `#set`/`#unset` symbols.
- **Phase 2.5** — known-but-passive INI sections (`[FILE_HEADER]`,
  `[VerbiageOverride]`, `[TurboBaud]`, `[Replay]`, `[ExtendedReplay]`,
  `[AccelerationWizard]`, `[EncodedData]`, `[TuningViews]`,
  `[EventTriggers]`, `[Tools]`) silently accepted; truly-unknown section
  names emit a one-time WARN per section so users notice INI grammar gaps
  without log flooding.
- **Phase 3.2** — `IndicatorPainter::Led` variant; `from_ts_string`
  recognizes `LedPainter`, `BulbIndicatorPainter`,
  `RectangleIndicatorPainter`, `BasicRectangleIndicatorPainter` aliases.

#### Changed
- **Phase 1.2** — `Packet::from_bytes` now defaults to strict scope-A-BE
  CRC per spec §15.1; permissive multi-scope brute-force is opt-in via
  `Packet::from_bytes_with_mode(data, permissive=true)` and gated behind
  `ConnectionConfig.permissive_crc`.
- **Phase 2.2** — `iniSpecVersion > 14` emits a cap warning during INI
  parsing.
- **Phase 2.6** — `[UiDialogs]` accepted as deprecated alias for
  `[UserDefined]` with a one-time INFO log.
- **Phase 3.3** — `clusterBackgroundImageStyle` (Tile/Stretch/Center/Fit)
  and `forceAspect{Width,Height}` confirmed lossless via dedicated
  round-trip test (`test_cluster_image_attrs_roundtrip`).
- **Phase 3.5** — MSQ writer now emits `firmwareInfo` and `nPages` on
  `<versionInfo>` for max stock-TunerStudio interop. New
  `TuneFile::firmware_info` field falls back to `signature` when unset.

#### Verified
- **Phase 3.4** — restore-point filename
  `{ProjectName}_{YYYY-MM-DD_HH.MM.SS}.msq` already matches spec §3.1
  (no change required).

#### Deferred
- **Phase 3.1** — `.tuneView` round-trip module (Sprint 3).
- **Phase 4.1** — `discover_ecu` probe matrix per spec §15.4
  (Sprint 3).
- **Phase 4.2** — full math-parser audit against published TS function
  list (Sprint 3).

### Phase 6 — App.tsx & DialogRenderer decomposition (Apr 26, 2026)

#### Changed
- **Folder reorg**: `src/components/{LoadingContext,ToastContext}.{tsx,css}`
  and `src/utils/useUnitPreferences.tsx` moved into a dedicated
  `src/contexts/` directory. All 10 import sites updated.
- **DialogRenderer.tsx split** (1,548 → 1,158 lines):
  - `dialogs/types.ts` — shared interfaces and helpers.
  - `dialogs/fields/Indicator.tsx` — single-light expression-driven indicator.
  - `dialogs/fields/IndicatorPanelRenderer.tsx` — grid-of-indicators panel.
  - `dialogs/fields/CommandButton.tsx` — controller-command button with
    warning dialog and auto-sync/reconnect.
  The big `DialogField` editor remains inline pending future work.

### Phase 7 — Rust core small cleanups (Apr 26, 2026)

#### Changed
- **Centralize dashboard code**: `crates/libretune-core/src/dashboard.rs`
  moved into `crates/libretune-core/src/dash/layout.rs`. The `dash` module
  now owns both LibreTune's native `DashboardLayout` representation and the
  TunerStudio XML format (`parser`, `writer`, `types`, `validation`).
- **Default dashboards source of truth**: deleted
  `crates/libretune-app/src/components/dashboards/LibreTuneDefaultDashboard.ts`
  and the `__libretune_default__` magic-path fallback in `TsDashboard.tsx`.
  Rust now seeds default dashboards (Basic / Tuning / Racing) on first run
  via `create_default_dashboard_files`; the frontend uses
  `list_available_dashes` / `get_dash_file` only.
- **realtime/evaluator.rs**: added module-level doc clarifying it is a
  derived-channel transform layer, not part of the streaming/transport stack.

#### Removed
- `crates/libretune-app/src/components/tuner-ui/AutoTuneLive.tsx` — single-
  line backwards-compat re-export with zero importers.

#### Fixed
- `smooth_table` weight-array indexing bug — already addressed in tree;
  AGENTS.md "Known Issues" entry trimmed and all 13 `table_ops` tests pass
  with 0 ignored.

### Phase 5 — `lib.rs` god-file split (Apr 2026)

#### Changed
- `crates/libretune-app/src-tauri/src/lib.rs` reduced from 14,475 lines to
  **419 lines** of pure registration glue (state setup +
  `invoke_handler!` manifest). All command bodies, helpers, and types
  extracted into 72 focused modules under `commands/`.
- Imports re-grouped (external → mod decls → `pub(crate)` re-exports →
  alphabetical command imports) with a module-level doc comment.
- `cargo check` clean; 12/12 lib tests pass.

### Phase 4 — UI consistency pass (Apr 2026)

#### Added
- Shared dialog/button/empty-state/form-field primitives under
  `src/components/common/`.
- `Dialog.Footer` convention: secondary buttons left, primary right
  (achieved via `flex-direction: row-reverse`).
- ~40 legacy theme-token aliases in `themes/variables.css`.

#### Changed
- 20+ dialogs migrated to the shared `Dialog` / `Button` / `FormField`
  primitives, dropping bespoke overlay markup and CSS.
- `tuner-ui/Dialogs.tsx` (Save/Load/Burn/NewTune/Settings/About/Connection)
  and `TsDashboard.tsx` (New/Rename/Delete) chrome converted.
- CSS hardcoded-hex sweep: ~600 hex literals reduced to ~100 bespoke ones,
  with the remainder behind theme tokens.
- All `lucide-react` icon migration; emoji literals removed from UI strings.
- `PopOutWindow.css` fully tokenized — pop-out windows now inherit theme.

### Phase 3 — Java plugin removal (Apr 2026)

#### Removed
- All Java/JVM plugin code, Tauri commands, and `PluginPanel.tsx` UI.
  WASM `plugin_system` is the supported plugin path.

### Phase 2 — Layout duplication (Apr 2026)

#### Removed
- The unused `src/components/layout/` directory (Header / Sidebar /
  MenuBar / ConnectionMetrics duplicates). The active layout lives in
  `src/components/tuner-ui/`.

### Phase 1 — Dead-code cleanup (Apr 2026)

#### Removed
- Misplaced Rust files inside the React tree (`mod.rs`, `types.rs`,
  `StatusBar.rsx`, `menubar.rsx`, etc.).
- Unreferenced TS files (`TestApp.tsx`, `libreTuneDefaultDashboardNew.ts`,
  `compatTest.ts`, `DialogWindow.tsx`, `SaveLoadBurnDialogs.tsx`).
- Canvas-based `TableEditor3D.tsx`; the react-three-fiber implementation
  was renamed in its place.
- `scripts/tauri-dev.sh.backup`.

## Pre-cleanup history

The entries below pre-date the Phase 1–8 cleanup pass and were preserved
verbatim from `AGENTS.md`. They are organized by date and sprint rather
than by Keep a Changelog section.

## Recent Changes (Session History)

### Realtime Stream Lock Contention Fix & Dashboard Tab Protection - Feb 28, 2026

#### Realtime Stream Fix: get_all_constant_values Connection Lock Starvation
- **Problem**: Dashboard gauges updated for ~2 seconds then froze permanently
- **Root Cause**: `get_all_constant_values()` read every scalar constant from the ECU individually over serial while holding `connection.lock()`. With rusEFI's hundreds of constants, this took many seconds or hung permanently, starving the realtime stream.
- **Evidence**: Stream log showed 80 `conn_lock busy` entries vs only 21 successful emits; connection lock was held permanently after ~2 seconds.
- **Fix** (`lib.rs`):
  - Rewrote `get_all_constant_values()` to **never acquire the connection lock**
  - Now reads exclusively from tune cache and tune file (already populated during sync)
  - Extracted reusable helpers: `read_constant_from_cache_or_tune()` and `read_constant_from_cache()`
  - Removed ~200 lines of duplicated ECU read code, replaced with clean helper calls
- **Diagnostics added** (`lib.rs`):
  - `CONN_LOCK_HOLDER` global atomic tracker records which function currently holds the connection lock
  - `set_conn_lock_holder()` / `get_conn_lock_holder()` helper functions
  - Stream log now reports WHO is holding the lock when `try_lock()` fails (e.g., `conn_lock busy (held by: sync_ecu_data)`)
  - Instrumented: `get_connection_status`, `sync_ecu_data`, `stream_loop`
- **Impact**: Realtime stream no longer starved by constant reads; gauges should update continuously

#### Dashboard Tab Protection
- **Problem**: Dashboard tab could be accidentally closed via middle-click or popout, with no way to reopen it
- **Fix 1** (`App.tsx` - `handleTabClose`):
  - Added guard: tabs with `closable: false` are now protected from closing
  - Checks the `closable` property before removing any tab
- **Fix 2** (`TabBar.tsx` - `handleMiddleClick`):
  - Middle-click close now checks `tab.closable !== false` before closing
  - Changed handler signature from `(e, tabId: string)` to `(e, tab: Tab)` for property access
- **Fix 3** (`App.tsx` - View menu):
  - Added **"Dashboard"** menu item to View menu as first entry
  - Re-creates dashboard tab if missing, or switches to it if present
  - Users can always recover the dashboard via **View → Dashboard**

### Sprint 5 - Advanced Table Editing (Part 2) - Active Feb 9, 2026
- **Feature**: Excel-style Row/Column Selection and Header Editing
- **Goal**: Make table headers interactive selection tools (click to select row/col) instead of static inputs, while preserving ability to edit bins via double-click.
- **Plan**:
  - Refactor `TableGrid.tsx` axis headers to use View/Edit modes.
  - Implement `headerDragStart` state for multi-row/col selection.
  - Add visual feedback for selected headers.
  - Ensure compatibility with existing `selectionRange` logic.

### rusEFI Console Support - Completed Feb 1-2, 2026

### Step 3: Console Protocol Implementation - Feb 1, 2026
- **Feature**: Text-based command/response protocol in libretune-core
- **Added** (`protocol/commands.rs`):
  - `ConsoleCommand` struct wrapping text commands for ECU transmission
  - `to_bytes()` helper that appends newline for ECU processing
  - `get_timeout_ms()` for command-specific timeouts
  - 4 unit tests for ConsoleCommand creation and serialization
- **Implemented** (`protocol/connection.rs`):
  - `send_console_command(&mut self, cmd: &ConsoleCommand) -> Result<String, ProtocolError>`
  - Uses same inter-character timeout detection as binary protocol
  - Sends command bytes (with newline) and reads response until timeout
  - Trims whitespace from response
  - Records metrics (tx_bytes, rx_bytes, packets)
- **Updated** (`protocol/mod.rs`):
  - Exported `ConsoleCommand` from module
- **Status**: 133 tests pass (all passing)

### Step 4: Tauri Backend Commands - Feb 1, 2026
- **Feature**: Backend API for console communication and ECU type discovery
- **Modified** (`AppState` struct):
  - Added `console_history: Mutex<Vec<String>>` field for command/response history
- **Implemented Tauri commands** (`lib.rs`):
  - `get_ecu_type() -> Result<String, String>` - Returns ECU type as debug string
  - `send_console_command(command: String) -> Result<String, String>` - Sends command, maintains history
  - `get_console_history() -> Result<Vec<String>, String>` - Retrieves full history
  - `clear_console_history() -> Result<(), String>` - Clears history
- **Command integration**:
  - All 4 commands added to Tauri `invoke_handler`
  - Error handling with user-friendly messages
  - History automatically capped at 1000 entries (LRU)
- **Status**: Release build successful

### Step 5: FOME Fast Comms Support - Feb 1, 2026
- **Feature**: Automatic protocol optimization for FOME ECUs with transparent fallback
- **Added** (`Settings` struct):
  - `fome_fast_comms_enabled: bool` setting (default true) - User-toggleable
- **Enhanced** (`send_console_command` function):
  - Detects FOME ECU type and setting
  - Attempts faster protocol path first (if conditions met)
  - Falls back to standard console protocol on ANY error (transparent to user)
  - No error propagation during fallback - works silently
  - Debug logging for troubleshooting (`[DEBUG]` and `[WARN]` messages)
- **User Experience**:
  - For FOME users: Faster console commands (when fast path available)
  - For non-FOME: Standard protocol always used
  - Toggle available in settings for advanced users
  - Fallback ensures reliability over speed
- **Status**: Compile verified (release build successful)

### Step 6: Console UI Component - Feb 2, 2026

    - Auto-scroll to bottom on new output
    - Usage hints placeholder when empty
    - Connected/disconnected state indicators
    - Loading state during command execution
  - Tauri API integration:
    - Calls `send_console_command()` for execution
    - Calls `get_console_history()` on component mount
    - Calls `clear_console_history()` on clear button
  - Error handling with user-friendly messages
  - Disabled when disconnected or ECU doesn't support console

  - Professional dark terminal theme with cyan accents (#00d9ff)
  - Glass-card style header and footer with backdrop effects
  - Responsive scrollbar styling (thin, custom colors)
  - Loading state animation (blinking cursor)
  - Color-coded output lines:
    - Cyan for commands (> prefix)
    - Gray for responses (<- prefix)
    - Red for errors (✗ prefix)
    - Orange for loading (… prefix)
  - Mobile-friendly (16px font size prevents iOS zoom on input)
  - Smooth transitions and hover effects
- **TypeScript Compilation**: Passes (no console component errors)

### Step 7: App Navigation Integration - Feb 2, 2026
- **Feature**: Console tab accessible from menu with context-aware visibility
- **Updated** (`App.tsx`):
  - Imported `EcuConsole` component from `components/console/EcuConsole`
  - Updated `TabContent` interface type to include `"console"`
  - Added `ecuType` state variable to track current ECU type
  - Enhanced `checkStatus()` function:

    - Label: "&ECU Console"
    - Target: Opens new tab "console" with title "Console - [EcuType]"
    - Disabled when: no project, not connected, or ECU doesn't support console
    - Only visible for RusEFI/FOME/epicEFI ECUs
    - Keyboard shortcut available: Alt+E (on Windows/Linux)
- **Status**: TypeScript compilation passes (no console-related errors)

- **Added** (`ini/types.rs`):
  - `EcuType` enum with variants: Speeduino, RusEFI, FOME, epicEFI, MS2, MS3, Unknown
  - `EcuType::detect()` method identifies ECU from INI signature and filename patterns
  - `supports_console()` method returns true for RusEFI/FOME/epicEFI
  - `is_fome()` method for FOME-specific optimizations
- **Added** (`ini/mod.rs`):
  - `ecu_type` field in `EcuDefinition` struct stores detected type
  - Default value set to `EcuType::Unknown`
- **Updated** (`ini/parser.rs`):
  - Auto-detect ECU type during INI parsing before returning definition
  - Import `EcuType` in module dependencies
- **Benefit**: Foundation for conditional console UI, FOME fast comms, and ECU-specific features
- **Status**: All tests pass (84+ unit tests), no breaking changes

### Build Number & Nightly Version Management - Completed Feb 1, 2026

- **Updated** (`CONTRIBUTING.md`):
  - Added "Version Management & Nightly Builds" section with clear guidelines
  - Documented build ID format and display location
  - Explained nightly vs. release versioning strategy
- **Status**: All CI checks pass, build metadata verified

### Build & Drag-Drop Features - Completed Jan 31, 2026

  - **Status**: Tested and working, pushed to GitHub (commit d6f06f5)

### AutoTune Table Lookup Fix - Completed Jan 11, 2026
- **Problem**: AutoTune failed with "Table veTable1 not found" for rusEFI/epicEFI INIs
- **Root Cause**: Frontend called non-existent `get_available_tables` command and hardcoded `veTable1`
- **Fix** (`tuner-ui/AutoTune.tsx`):
  - Changed `get_available_tables` → `get_tables` (correct backend command)
  - Added VE table auto-detection: tries `veTableTbl`, `veTable1Tbl`, `veTable1`, etc.
  - Sorted table list: VE/fuel tables first, then alphabetically
  - Fallback to first VE-related table or first table overall
- **Fix** (`TableComparisonDialog.tsx`): Changed `get_available_tables` → `get_tables`
- **Fix** (`App.tsx`): Changed hardcoded `"veTable1"` to `""` for auto-detection
- **Cleanup**: Deleted unused `realtime/AutoTune.tsx` (tuner-ui version is active)

### INI Version Tracking & Tune Migration - Completed Jan 11, 2026

  - `generate_ini_metadata()` - Combines hash + manifest + timestamp into IniMetadata

- **Migration detection** (`tune/migration.rs` - NEW):
  - `MigrationReport` struct with: `missing_in_tune`, `missing_in_ini`, `type_changed`, `scale_changed`, `can_auto_migrate`, `requires_user_review`, `severity`
  - `ConstantChange` struct for detailed change info (old/new type, scale, offset, translate)
  - `compare_manifests()` function compares saved manifest against current INI definition
  - Severity levels: "none", "low" (new constants), "medium" (scale changes), "high" (type changes/removals)
  - Unit tests for empty manifest and summary generation

- **Backend integration** (`lib.rs`):
  - `save_tune()` now populates `ini_metadata` and `constant_manifest` before saving

  - Lists first 20 items in each section with "...and N more" for larger lists
  - "Dismiss" and "Continue with Tune" buttons
  - Auto-opens when `tune:migration_needed` event is received

### User-Configurable Status Bar - Completed Jan 11, 2026
- **Settings persistence** (`lib.rs`):
  - Added `status_bar_channels: Vec<String>` to Settings struct with `#[serde(default)]`
  - Updated `get_status_bar_defaults` to check user settings first before INI FrontPage/common defaults

  - Added `read_axis_bins()` helper to read table axis values from tune cache
  - Falls back to generated linear bins if data not available
  - Handles both RPM-like (wide range) and MAP-like (narrow range) axes

### Table Operations Integration - Completed Jan 11, 2026
- **Fixed table editing toolbar operations** (`lib.rs`):
  - All 5 Tauri commands were stubs returning "requires ECU connection" error
  - Now properly wired to `libretune_core::table_ops` functions
  - Added `get_table_data_internal()` helper for code reuse
  - Added `update_table_z_values_internal()` helper for saving changes

  - `smooth_table` - 2D Gaussian weighted averaging of selected cells
  - `interpolate_cells` - Bilinear interpolation between corner cells
  - `scale_cells` - Multiply selected cells by factor
  - `set_cells_equal` - Set selected cells to average value
  - `rebin_table` - Change axis bins with Z-value interpolation

- **Frontend performance improvements** (`TableEditor2D.tsx`):
  - `handleScale` now calls single backend command instead of N individual `update_table_data` calls

### Known Issues
- (none currently tracked at this level — see CHANGELOG / issue tracker)

### lastOffset Keyword Support - Completed Dec 31, 2025
- **Root Cause**: Constants like `afrTable` use `lastOffset` keyword instead of numeric offset
  - INI line: `afrTable = array, U08, lastOffset, [16x16], "AFR", 0.1, 0.0, 7, 25.5, 1`
  - Parser was returning None when offset couldn't parse as u16, skipping the constant entirely
  
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `last_offset: u16` field to `ParserState` struct (parser.rs)
  - `last_offset` resets to 0 when page changes
  - After parsing each constant, `last_offset` is updated to `offset + size_in_bytes`
  - `parse_constant_line()` now accepts `last_offset` parameter
  - When offset field equals "lastOffset" (case-insensitive), uses the running counter value
  
- **Files modified**:
  - [parser.rs](crates/libretune-core/src/ini/parser.rs) - ParserState, parse_constants_entry
  - [constants.rs](crates/libretune-core/src/ini/constants.rs) - parse_constant_line signature and logic
  
- **Test added**: `test_parse_constant_line_lastoffset` verifies keyword handling

### MenuBar Duplicate Key Fix - Completed Dec 31, 2025
- **Issue**: React warning about duplicate keys for menu separators
- **Fix**: Updated `renderMenuItem()` to use index-based unique keys
- **File**: [MenuBar.tsx](crates/libretune-app/src/components/layout/MenuBar.tsx)

### PcVariables & std_separator Fix - Completed Dec 31, 2025
- **Issue 1 - std_separator showing as menu item**:
  - Root Cause: `std_separator` targets created `MenuItem::Std` instead of `MenuItem::Separator`
  - Fix: Added check for `target == "std_separator"` before the `target.starts_with("std_")` check in [parser.rs](crates/libretune-core/src/ini/parser.rs#L1242)

- **Issue 2 - PcVariables not available to dialogs** ("Loading..." shown):
  - Root Cause: `[PcVariables]` like `rpmwarn`, `rpmdang` were only stored as byte values, not full `Constant` structs
  - Fix: Added `parse_pc_variable_line()` function to create proper constants from PcVariables
  
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `is_pc_variable: bool` field to `Constant` struct (default `false`)
  - Added `parse_pc_variable_line()` in [constants.rs](crates/libretune-core/src/ini/constants.rs) - parses PcVariable format (no offset field)
  - Updated `parse_pc_variable_entry()` to use new function and store in `def.constants`
  - Added `default_values: HashMap<String, f64>` to `EcuDefinition` for INI defaults
  - Added `[Defaults]` section parsing (`defaultValue = name, value` entries)
  - Added `local_values: HashMap<String, f64>` to `TuneCache` for PC variable storage
  - Updated `get_constant_value` to check `is_pc_variable` and return from local cache or defaults
  - Updated `update_constant` to store PC variables locally instead of writing to ECU

- **Value Resolution Order** for PcVariables:
  1. User-set value in `cache.local_values`
  2. INI default in `def.default_values`
  3. Constant min value (last resort)

- **Tests added**: `test_parse_pc_variable_line_scalar`, `test_parse_pc_variable_line_bits`

### Current Status
- **Build Status**: All builds passing (Rust + TypeScript)
- **Test Status**: 84+ tests passing, 2 ignored
- **CI Status**: GitHub Actions workflow ready
- **Trademark Status**: Clean - all proprietary terminology removed
- **UI Status**: Gauges rendering correctly with live data; Dashboard tab protected from accidental close
- **Backend Status**: AutoTune module functional with heatmap support
- **Realtime Streaming**: Event-based streaming (50ms intervals) with `try_lock()` contention handling and lock-holder diagnostics
- **Connection Lock**: `get_all_constant_values` no longer holds connection lock; reads from cache/tune only
- **Cross-Platform**: Fully cross-platform path handling (Windows/macOS/Linux)
- **Dashboard Format**: TunerStudio XML format support with 3 default templates

### Cross-Platform Path Implementation - Completed
- **Replaced hardcoded Unix paths** with Tauri's cross-platform APIs:
  - `get_app_data_dir()` - Uses `tauri::AppHandle::path().app_data_dir()` with `dirs` crate fallback
  - `get_projects_dir()` - Cross-platform projects directory
  - `get_definitions_dir()` - Cross-platform ECU definitions directory
  - `get_settings_path()` - Cross-platform settings.json location

- **Updated lib.rs commands**:
  - `get_available_inis()` - Now accepts `app: tauri::AppHandle`
  - `load_ini()` - Now uses `Path::new(&path).is_absolute()` instead of Unix-specific check
  - `auto_load_last_ini()` - Now accepts app handle
  - `save_tune()` - Uses `Project::projects_dir()` from libretune-core
  - `list_tune_files()` - Uses cross-platform path resolution
  - `list_dashboard_layouts()` - Uses cross-platform path resolution

- **Updated dashboard.rs**:
  - `get_dashboard_file_path()` - Uses `Project::projects_dir()` from project module

- **Added Linux-only guard** in serial.rs:
  - `/dev` directory fallback scan wrapped in `#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]`

- **Added dirs crate** to libretune-app/Cargo.toml for fallback path resolution

### WebKit / Tauri Launch Fix
**Issue**: Tauri app crashed on startup with WebKit internal error due to Snap environment variable leakage causing libpthread symbol lookup failures.

**Solution**: Launch Tauri with a sanitized environment to prevent Snap library paths from interfering:
```bash
./scripts/tauri-dev.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
env -i PATH="$PATH" HOME="$HOME" DISPLAY="$DISPLAY" XAUTHORITY="$XAUTHORITY" \
  XDG_RUNTIME_DIR="$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR" TERM="$TERM" \
  bash -lc 'cd crates/libretune-app && npm run tauri dev'
```

This preserves only essential environment variables (PATH, HOME, DISPLAY) and removes Snap-related vars that cause WebKit to load incompatible libraries.

### Multi-ECU Support & Dynamic Configuration - Completed Dec 31, 2025

**Table Map Name Lookup Fix** (fixes "Fuel Table" not opening):
- **Root Cause**: INI `[TableEditor]` format: `table = tableName, mapName, "Title", page`
  - Tables indexed by `tableName` (e.g., "veTable1Tbl")
  - Menus reference tables by `mapName` (e.g., "veTable1Map")
  - Lookup was failing because it only checked by tableName

- **Changes made**:
  - Added `map_name: Option<String>` field to `TableDefinition` in [tables.rs](crates/libretune-core/src/ini/tables.rs)
  - Added `table_map_to_name: HashMap<String, String>` to `EcuDefinition` in [mod.rs](crates/libretune-core/src/ini/mod.rs)
  - Updated parser to store map_name and build reverse lookup in [parser.rs](crates/libretune-core/src/ini/parser.rs)
  - Added `get_table_by_name_or_map()` method for fallback lookup
  - Updated all `def.tables.get()` calls in [lib.rs](crates/libretune-app/src-tauri/src/lib.rs) to use new resolver

**Channel Discovery API** (enables dynamic status bar & dashboard):
- Added Tauri commands:
  - `get_available_channels()` - Returns all output channels from INI [OutputChannels]
  - `get_status_bar_defaults()` - Returns suggested channels from FrontPage or common defaults

**Dynamic Status Bar** (App.tsx):
- Removed hardcoded "RPM" and "AFR" status indicators
- Status bar now shows channels from `get_status_bar_defaults()` API
- Falls back to common channel names (RPM, AFR, MAP, TPS, coolant) if FrontPage unavailable
- Added `statusBarChannels` state initialized from backend

**Dynamic Dashboard Gauges** (TabbedDashboard.tsx):
- Removed 5 hardcoded gauge definitions (rpm, afr, clt, tps, map)
- Dashboard now builds gauges from:
  1. FrontPage gauge references (if available)
  2. First 4 gauges from [GaugeConfigurations] (fallback)
  3. Minimal single-gauge fallback (last resort)
- Added `BackendGaugeInfo` interface matching lib.rs `GaugeInfo` struct
- `buildGaugeConfig()` helper creates GaugeConfig from INI gauge definitions
- Min/max/units/warnings now come from INI instead of hardcoded values

**Files modified**:
- Backend: tables.rs, mod.rs, parser.rs, lib.rs
- Frontend: App.tsx, TabbedDashboard.tsx

### Java Plugin System Deprecation - Completed Feb 4, 2026
- **Overall Task**: Deprecate Java/JVM plugin system in favor of native WASM plugin system (Sprint 3)
- **Status**: Step 1 Complete - UI disabled, deprecation notices added, grace period begins
- **Timeline**: 2-4 releases (6-12 months) before complete removal

- **Step 1 Implementation (Feb 4, 2026)**:
  1. **Created** (`DEPRECATION_NOTICE.md`):
     - Comprehensive 400-line deprecation announcement
     - Timeline: Feb 4, 2026 → Grace period → Removal (TBD)
     - Migration guide preview (Java → WASM)
     - Community feedback request
     - FAQ section addressing user concerns
     - Technical details on affected components (~5,100 lines)
  
  2. **Updated** (`App.tsx`):
     - Commented out "Plugins..." menu item in Tools menu
     - Added deprecation comment with reference to DEPRECATION_NOTICE.md
     - Users cannot access Java plugin UI in new builds
  
  3. **Updated** (`lib.rs`):
     - Added deprecation warnings to `load_plugin()` command
     - Added deprecation warnings to `unload_plugin()` command
     - Added deprecation warnings to `get_plugin_ui()` command
     - All Java plugin commands now log ⚠️ warnings to stderr
  
  4. **Updated** (`AGENTS.md`):
     - Marked "Add plugin system" as COMPLETED (WASM system)
     - Added "Java/JVM plugin system" as DEPRECATED entry
     - This section documents the deprecation process

- **Affected Components** (~5,100 lines total):
  - **Java Source**: 19 files (~2,000 lines)
    - `plugin-host/src/main/java/com/libretune/pluginhost/` (8 files)
    - `plugin-host/src/main/java/com/tunerstudio/plugin/api/` (11 stubs)
  - **Rust Backend**: 4 files (~1,042 lines)
    - `src/plugin/{mod.rs,manager.rs,bridge.rs,types.rs}`
  - **TypeScript Frontend**: 7 files (~1,878 lines)
    - `src/components/plugin/` (PluginPanel, SwingRenderer, EventBridge, etc.)
  - **Tauri Commands**: 8 commands (~192 lines)
  - **Build System**: Gradle files, bundled JAR resources

- **Rationale**:
  - **Maintenance Burden**: Separate Java codebase, Gradle build, JRE detection
  - **Security Concerns**: Full JVM permissions, no sandboxing, no resource limits
  - **External Dependency**: Requires JRE 11+ on user systems
  - **Architectural Redundancy**: WASM plugin system provides superior isolation
  - **User Confusion**: Two competing plugin systems with no clear guidance

- **WASM Plugin System** (Sprint 3 - Active):
  - Location: `crates/libretune-core/src/{plugin_system.rs,plugin_api.rs}`
  - Features: Permission model, sandboxing, no external dependencies
  - Tests: 37 unit tests (18 plugin_system + 19 plugin_api)
  - Documentation: SPRINT_3_SUMMARY.md (comprehensive implementation guide)
  - UI: PluginPanel.tsx (250+ lines, glass-card design)

- **Next Steps** (Completed Steps 1-3, Feb 4-5, 2026):
  - [x] **Step 1**: Add deprecation notices and disable UI (Feb 4, 2026)
  - [x] **Step 2**: Create migration guide documentation (Feb 5, 2026)
  - [x] **Step 3**: Update documentation indices (Feb 5, 2026)
  - [ ] **Step 4**: Grace period monitoring (ongoing, 2-4 releases)
  - [ ] **Step 5**: Remove all Java plugin code after grace period (~5,100 lines)

- **Community Impact**:
  - **Unknown**: No telemetry on Java plugin usage
  - **Risk**: Users may rely on TunerStudio JAR plugins
  - **Mitigation**: Grace period, migration guide, example WASM plugins (Sprint 4)

- **Documentation Status**:
  - ✅ DEPRECATION_NOTICE.md created (comprehensive, 400+ lines)
  - ✅ README.md updated with deprecation notice
  - ✅ Migration guide created (docs/src/reference/java-to-wasm-migration.md)
  - ✅ Documentation indices updated (SUMMARY.md + toc.json)
  - ✅ Dual documentation system synchronized (docs/src + public/manual)
  - ⏳ User-facing announcement (website/forum TBD)

- **Code Status**:
  - ✅ UI disabled (menu item commented out)
  - ✅ Backend warnings added (stderr logging)
  - ✅ AGENTS.md updated (this section)
  - ✅ All code still functional (but deprecated)
  - ⏳ Removal scheduled for after grace period (Steps 4-5)
